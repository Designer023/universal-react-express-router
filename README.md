# Universal ReactJS, ExpressJS and React-Router Boilerplate

Basic isomorphic app built on [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux)

```
$ npm run dev
$ browser http://localhost:3000
```

Inspired (heavily) by https://github.com/bananaoomarang/isomorphic-redux/blob/master/README.md with a few bits stripped out to help me understand serverside rendering before I mess with Redux!
